# Specious: a simple, persistent, key-value store

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/specious-db.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/specious-db)

A simple key-value store following the design of LevelDB, as a prototype of a verified key-value store.

We are aiming for the following basic design:
- crash safety using a write-ahead log
- transactional writes (which use the same transaction)
- recovery
- background compaction
